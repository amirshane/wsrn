# Simulation of WSRN Algorithm (Harvard CS 229BR Final Project)
This repository consists of the code, data, and write-up for my final project for Harvard's 2019 iteration of CS 229BR: Biology and Complexity, taught by Professor Leslie Valiant. In this project, I perform some simulation and analysis of the WSRN algorithm and mutator, which were designed by Professor Paul Valiant for the evolution of real polynomials. For a more in-depth explanation please see the write-up. 

The code is all self contained requiring only Python 3 and the numpy module. Regarding the data, it is presented in text files where the label n-m-k-p.txt denotes the evolution of polynomials from an n-dimensional domain to an m-dimensional codomain with degree at most k using the Lp loss function (defined in the paper). In these .txt files the data is presented in pairs of liners, where the first line is of the form [n, m, k, r, c, p] where n, m, k, p are defined above, r is the bound on the coefficients of the polynomial, and c is the number of children per generation of the WSRN-Mutator. The second line contains 8 numbers, which include empirical averages (over 100 samples) of the number of generations needed to evolve two uniformly randomly generated polynomials under parameters n, m, k, r, c, p to the errors 0.01, 0.0075, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.001, 0.00075, 0.0005, 0.00025, respectively.
